## 🔧 Hardware Part (Raspberry Pi Pico)

This project uses several sensors connected to a Raspberry Pi Pico:

- **Soil Moisture Sensor**
- **DHT11 Temperature & Humidity Sensor**
- **LDR Light Sensor**

Each sensor has its script in the `Hardware/` folder.

> These scripts read data and send it for further processing or display.

---

## 💻 Software Part (ML App)

- A mobile app was developed to interact with the Raspberry Pi Pico and make predictions using a **trained machine learning model**.
- The **model.zip** file in `Software/` contains the trained model used for prediction.
- The app code is not open-source here, but the model used for inference is shared.

> For detailed app usage and integration, refer to `Software/README.txt`.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. **Connect all sensors** to Raspberry Pi Pico as per the diagram.
2. Upload the appropriate code from the `Hardware/` folder.
3. Use the mobile app (not included here) to:
   - Collect sensor data
   - Make predictions using the ML model
4. Optional: Host the model or use it within the app using the zipped file.
